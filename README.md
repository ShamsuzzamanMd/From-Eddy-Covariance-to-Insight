# AsiaFLUX 2025 – R and Jupyter Binder Environment

This repository provides teaching materials for data processing, gap-filling, and carbon budget analysis using both **R (RStudio)** and **Jupyter notebooks** on Binder.

## Launch the Environment

You can launch Binder in either RStudio or JupyterLab:

| Environment | Launch Link |
|--------------|--------------|
| **RStudio** | [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ShamsuzzamanMd/Binder/main?urlpath=rstudio) |
| **JupyterLab** | [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ShamsuzzamanMd/Binder/main?urlpath=lab) |

### Contents
- `2 EC Data Gap-filling using REddyProc R Studio version.Rmd` – R Markdown tutorial  
- `2 REddyProc Jupyter version.ipynb` – Jupyter-based version of the same analysis  
- `install.R`, `requirements.txt`, and `runtime.txt` – environment configuration files  
- `index.ipynb` – optional launch notebook

### Notes
- Binder may take a few minutes to build the environment the first time.  
- You can switch between R and Python kernels inside JupyterLab.  
- For reproducibility, the R and Python dependencies are pinned in the setup files.
